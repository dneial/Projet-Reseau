1. Server: read graph
2. Client: launch x clients where x is the number of sommets in graph
3. Server: wait for all x clients to connect
4. Server: for each clients, tell them the number of out sockets and in sockets
5. Client: create x out sockets and x in sockets
6. Client: send addresses of each in sockets to the server
7. Server: save addresses of each in sockets in a matrix of size nb of clients x nb of clients
8. Server: use the adjacency matrix to send the addresses of each in sockets to each client
